## Project Description

This project contains the code for a Blackjack application, a collaboration between close friends Sam ([@SHarrison00](https://github.com/SHarrison00)) and Conor ([@ConorHoughton2000](https://github.com/ConorHoughton2000)). The objectives of this project were to develop a simple Blackjack Python application, with a focus on adhering to programming best practices and writing maintainable code.

The purpose of this project and collaboration was to offer mutual benefits. As a junior developer, Conor utilized this project to practice and improve his Python skills. Meanwhile, Sam, who has several years of experience in Python, served as a mentor to Conor, thereby further developing his own mentorship abilities.

## How It Works

To start a game of Blackjack, run the command `python main.py`, which calls the `start_game()` function in `game.py`. Each round, the `start_round()` function from `round.py` is invoked, and games continue until the player goes bankrupt or decides to end the game. All of Blackjack's logic is encapsulated in `logic.py`, containing the building blocks upon which the rest of the game is constructed.
