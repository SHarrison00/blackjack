## Project Description

Sam ([@SHarrison00](https://github.com/SHarrison00)) and Conor ([@ConorHoughton2000](https://github.com/ConorHoughton2000)), lifelong friends, are collaborating on a project to create a quality Blackjack application, focusing on writing clean and maintainable code.

With over 3 years of Python experience, I (Sam) will be there to provide guidance and leadership, while Conor, who's new to Python, will be taking the lead in most of the development.

This partnership offers mutual benefits. Conor will gain valuable Python experience, while I will have the opportunity to share my knowledge and improve my mentoring skills. Driven by our shared passion for Blackjack, games, and data analytics, this project is a testament to our enduring friendship.
